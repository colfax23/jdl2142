Hi!


I am interested in this meetup:
http://www.meetup.com/rubyblind/events/109802702/ 
on:
Wednesday, April 10, 2013 at 6:45 PM.

I only made the User models .rb file, since views and controllers weren't really covered in class yet and all the documentation on scaffold seemed mostly relevant to SQL and I know we will be using Mongo.

Got Hello,World working as well, tried to understand how routing and CSS works, you'll understand when you take a look.

Best,
Jason.
